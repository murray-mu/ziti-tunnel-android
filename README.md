# Ziti Mobile Edge for Android

This is the Ziti Mobile Edge application released in Google Play store and commonly referred to as "ZME" or "the
OpenZiti tunneler for Android."

As a Kotlin application, it leverages [the OpenZiti Tunnel SDK](https://github.com/openziti/ziti-tunnel-sdk-c?tab=readme-ov-file#readme). In Android, this app is a VPN connector
that provides a nameserver for resolving the addresses of any authorized OpenZiti Services.
